## Gist:
* I intended to use synthetic data.
* SC-inspired
* Plans & glyphs


## About:
* This Glyphnet pioneered use of synthetic data in 2019.
* Includes
    * Trainig Neural Networks
    * used Tensorflow 2 (was new at the time)
* The PoC was in December 2019 (last edit was 30 December 2019)
* This repo is deprecated, since, my experimentations with neural networks are elsewhere.

## History:
* V1: 30 December 2019
    * See branch `glyphnet-v1` : https://github.com/sohale/neural-networks-sandbox/tree/glyphnet-v1
    * i.e. tag `v1-30-dec-2019`: https://github.com/sohale/neural-networks-sandbox/releases/tag/v1-30-dec-2019
* New directions
* New direction: revival:
    * I intended to use synthetic data from gf
    * Moving to a new repo: `glyphnet`
    * New developments moved to: https://github.com/sohale/glyphnet
    * Glyphnet originally resided here, and it can be a spin-off of this. It will complately change.
    * Both versions are written from sctatch by me and are originally mine, and are original idea
